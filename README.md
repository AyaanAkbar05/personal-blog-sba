This is a small interactive blog web app where you can create, edit, and delete your own blog posts, all right in the browser
The posts are saved in localStorage, so they stay even if you refresh or close the tab.

How to run:
-Download or clone this project folder.
-Open the folder and find the file named index.html.
-Double-click index.html (or right-click → “Open with Browser”).
-Start writing your posts! You can add, edit, or delete them freely.
-Posts are saved automatically in your browser.
-Refresh the page — they’ll still be there.

Reflection:
Building this project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
The hardest part was figuring out how to:
-Use localStorage to save and load posts.
-Update a specific post when editing instead of adding a new one.
I overcame these challenges by breaking the problem into smaller steps:
First, I learned how to add posts to an array. Then I learned how to display them dynamically on the page. Finally, I connected localStorage so everything would stay after refresh.

It was a great exercise to practice DOM manipulation and event handling!

Missing features:
-There’s no option to upload images or categorize posts yet.
-The design is very simple — more CSS styling could make it look nicer.
-Posts don’t have timestamps showing when they were created or updated.
